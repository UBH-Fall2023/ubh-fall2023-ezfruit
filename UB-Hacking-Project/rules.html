    Welcome to Gladiator's Odyssey! You will fight to the death against the warrior Titan Knight. However, you will be able to choose which class you want to be. Each class differs in health, damage, and fighting potential. 
    <p id = "mage">Mage - Health: 15, Shield: 0, Max Mana: 6, Damage: 6 (3 Mana) Empower: 9</p>
    <p id = "warrior">Warrior - Health: 20, Shield: 2, Max Mana: 5, Damage: 4 (2 Mana), Empower: 6</p>
    <p id = "tank">Tank - Health: 30, Shield: 5, Max Mana: 4, Damage: 2 (1 Mana), Empower: 3</p>
    Your health is what determines if you lose or win the game. Your shield is how much damage you can take before your health starts to drop (Defending will restore some shield). Empowered attacks do more damage than normal attacks, but cost more mana. Your mana is your resource bar. You can use the wait or sleep actions to restore mana.
    Good Luck!
